# When to Boost: How Dose Timing Determines the Epidemic Threshold

The repository contains code and data used in the paper [When to Boost: How Dose Timing Determines the Epidemic Threshold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16715). 

The pickle files contain the network analyzed in the paper, they are stored as [NetworkX](https://networkx.org) graphs. 
We simulated the $S^3I^2$ model adapting the package [EoN](https://epidemicsonnetworks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) on three different networks: i) an Erdős--Rényi--Gilbert~(ER) graph; 
ii) the [Enron](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/email-Enron.html) email network, and iii) a geometric random graph generated using the [$\mathbb{S}^1$ model](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.078701).
